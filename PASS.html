<p>PASS (Provenance-Aware Storage System) produces audit trails for data products by monitoring the operating system kernel. These audit trails are stored in a database and can be queried. The system supports application-generated provenance to be written into the same database to produce an integrated view of application and system-level provenance.</p>
