<p>The Virtual CD-ROM / Floppy Disk Library aims at preserving access to CD-ROMs, DVDs, and floppy disks that have been received since the 1980s by the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), and that contain valuable data on a variety of domains, such as economics, population, and life and physical sciences.</p>
