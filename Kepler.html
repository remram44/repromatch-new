<h1>Kepler</h1>

<p>Site: <a href="https://kepler-project.org/">https://kepler-project.org/</a></p>


<p>Kepler is designed to help scienÂ­tists, analysts, and computer programmers create, execute, and share models and analyses across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.  Kepler can operate on data stored in a variety of formats, locally and over the internet, and is an effective environment for integrating disparate software components, such as merging "R" scripts with compiled "C" code, or facilitating remote, distributed execution of models.</p>
