<h1>Paper Mache</h1>


<p>The tool has basically two components: the Paper Mache Workbench (a Web-based application) and the Paper Mache Hypervisor (a desktop application). Using the workbench, authors create packages that contain the full paper – text, figures, audio and video – together with a virtual image that includes the computational processes responsible for the results presented in the paper.</p>
