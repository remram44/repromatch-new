<p>figshare is a repository on the Web where scientists can upload and share their research data. Every asset automatically receives a DOI which allows persistent data citation. figshare also encourages the publication of negative data (i.e., negative results or results that were not planned to be published), which are also citable, to help understand the entire reasoning behind the experiment.</p>
