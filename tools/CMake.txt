name: CMake
portability: LOW
portability_note: Makefiles can be re-compiled in the same machine to reproduce experiment
  findings, but portability to other environments cannot be automatically guaranteed
  without extra work, e.g., unless the user defines explicit commands to be executed
  in different operating systems and hardware architectures.

replicability_note: Given a makefile, a user can re-execute the experiment.

representation_note: Makefiles can be used as an executable representation for the
  experiment.
