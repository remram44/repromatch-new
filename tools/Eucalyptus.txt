Eucalyptus is a free and open-source computer software for building Amazon Web Services (AWS)-compatible private and hybrid cloud computing environments marketed by the company Eucalyptus Systems. Eucalyptus is the acronym for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems. It enables pooling compute, storage, and network resources that can be dynamically scaled up or down as application workloads change.
