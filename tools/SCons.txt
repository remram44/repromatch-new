name: SCons
portability: LOW
portability_note: The scripts can be re-used in the same machine to reproduce experiment
  findings, but portability to other environments cannot be automatically guaranteed
  without extra work, e.g., unless the user takes care of different operating systems
  and hardware architectures.
