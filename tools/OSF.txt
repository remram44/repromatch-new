The Open Science Framework is a Web-based portal and repository to archive and share research data. The repository implements a frontend to Git, abstracting the Git interface and automatically versioning all uploaded files. Scientists can revisit old states of an experiment, and also “freeze” a particular state to be shared among researchers (e.g., for a paper publication).
