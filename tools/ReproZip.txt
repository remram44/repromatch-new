name: ReproZip
paper: http://bigdata.poly.edu/~fchirigati/papers/chirigati-sigmod2013.pdf
portability: HIGH
portability_note: ReproZip provides support for unpacking the experiment in a virtual
  machine (using Vagrant) or in a Docker container.
replicability: true
replicability_note: ReproZip provides an easy-to-use command line interface to replicate
  the experiment.
representation: true
representation_descriptive_only: true
representation_executable: true
representation_note: ReproZip creates a configuration file (descriptive-only representation)
  that details all the provenance related to the experiment. Besides, it can create
  a scientific workflow (VisTrails) for the experiment (executable representation).

supports_note: For packing the experiment, ReproZip only supports Linux (since it
  uses ptrace), but it does support all the other platforms for the unpacking step.

-----

ReproZip is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains all the binaries, files, and dependencies required to run a given command on the authorâ€™s computational environment. A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his own environment to reproduce the results, even if the environment has a different operating system from the original one.
