SHARE (Sharing Hosted Autonomous Research Environments) is a Web portal where virtual machines can be created, shared and accessed. The main idea is for authors to upload a virtual machine image related to their experiment, which can then be linked to into the paper: the image contains everything that is necessary to reproduce the results.
