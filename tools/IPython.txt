IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with: (i) powerful interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based); (ii) a browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other rich media; (iii) support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits; (iv) flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects; and (v) easy to use, high performance tools for parallel computing.
