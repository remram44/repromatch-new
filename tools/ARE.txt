The Author-Review-Execute Environment (A-R-E) focuses on the review process of a paper and on the communication among authors, reviewers and publishers. In this system, a scientific paper is presented using Information Workbench, a semantic Wiki-based tool: authors import their papers to the system and include links to internal and external resources (e.g., a semantic database).
