<h1>SOLE</h1>


<p>SOLE (Science Object Linking and Embedding) presents documents in HTML format, where users associate sets of words in the document with tags, and each tag refers to a URL specification of a science object: a science object, in this case, can be source code, a dataset repository, an annotated PDF file, or a virtual machine image that can be deployed in the cloud by using package managers, e.g., packing tools and configuration management tools.</p>
